# Joint Savings Accounts - Smart Contracts: Challenge_20

Here we are creating automated joint savings accounts through a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses basic ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Running a Deposit Transaction - received a successful outcome.
